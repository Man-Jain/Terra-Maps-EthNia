# Terra-Maps-EthNia

A Decentralised Maps with locations and incentivised support from local people 

## Problem 

In the current market situation for geospatial data, Google dominates consumer mapping, followed by HERE, a company jointly owned by the largest German automotive companies. Even among these, Google is the one that holds the majority of data. OSM has emerged as one of the open-source alternatives. Still, it lacks certain aspects like verifiability of data points since anyone can make changes, another solution is FOAM, but it cannot scale. This is also an issue with other providers like Google and HERE. All the above problems make the data highly centralized and cause the cost of using this data in applications to skyrocket. 

With the advent of blockchain technology that can revolutionize traditional applications by introducing trust, verifiability, and censorship resistance, applications will need consensus-driven geospatial data to be verified and trusted. 

This also can be a good boost for the tourist industry since for now Most of the tourists comes to the city, visit a few well known places and departs before even getting to see the real ethnicity and the places which does not have well sung sagas for them.

A community of travellers, proof of presence on an awesome place, incentivised support from local people and a review system based on reputation, all these combined would give us an opportunity to get all the nooks and corners of the city explored by tourists.

## Implementation 

The current implementation for the whole idea can be divided into two parts 

a. The Decentralised Maps Platform
b. Review and Place of Interest sharing platform

### Part A - Terra Maps

We don't have a this implemented currenty on the EVM but an MVP is ready on a differnt blockchain platform which shows platform's functionalities and it's user flow.

### Part B - EthNia

A community of travellers and local people sharing amazing places of a city powered by the Terra Maps ecosystem. 
A MVP is already deployed on the `Binance Smart Chain` and hosted on the IPFS as well as Web2 infrastructure.

Both the projects have an amazing scope to build a great community of users and empower people using it. 


## Future Scope

- In future we are planning to merge the two projects to make them into one and share the functionaluty and dependencies among each other. The Terra Maps platform can gather huge help from EthNia by people feeding the data of amazing places around them while EthNia can use the whole underlying maps infrastructure for free.

- The tokenomics for Terra Maps can drive the whole platform while the NFT marketplace in EthNia can give it it's own unique selling feature.
